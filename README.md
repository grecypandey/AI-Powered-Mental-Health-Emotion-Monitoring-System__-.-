🧠 AI Powered Mental and Emotional Health Detection System

This project focuses on detecting an individual’s mental and emotional state using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques.
The system analyzes user input (such as text, behavior, or emotional patterns) to identify emotions like stress, anxiety, sadness, happiness, or neutrality and provides meaningful insights.

Mental health is an important aspect of overall well-being, and this project aims to support early detection and awareness using modern AI technology.
